# Moonpig Machine Learning Ops Challenge (Python)

We would like you to complete a classification pipeline. 

# Classification
We use an XGBoost model for predicting the AGE of abalone from physical measurements.
The AGE of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone and counting the number of rings through a microscope

We have prepared a dataset that can be found at ./data/raw_data.csv.
It is consists of seven numerical and one categorical column. the last column is the class label (Ring) which indicated the age of abalone. 

## Technical requirements

1. Complete the missing functionalities with Python.
1. Feel free to refactor/extend the existing solution.
1. Use Git for version control.
1. Make sure you update the dependencies (requirement.txt) 

## What we're looking for

1. **Your Python skills.** How you code, what libraries/utilities you use.
1. **How you implement the missing functionalities.** clear naming, reused codes, easy to follow.
1. **Your machine learning knowledge** how to evaluate the model. how to preprocess data
1. **How you use version control.** There are no hard and fast rules here, but we expect you to demonstrate a pragmatic use of version control. Frequent commits are better.

## What we're not looking for

1. **Cross-cutting concerns** like logging, monitoring and authentication.
1. **Specific coding conventions,** as long as you are clear, consistent and concise.
1. **Complexity.** Keep things simple and straightforward.

## How do I submit my solution?

Please fork the project and make a pull request - according to the directions given to you by the recruiter who sent you the test.

Also submit a README file detailing:

1. How to build, run and call your pipeline.
2. A brief description of your approach and any key assumptions and design decisions you made during implementation (250 words max).

## How long should I spend on this?

Your time is important. We're anticipating that you'll spend **2 to 3 hours** working on this from start to finish. Please try and limit yourself to not much more than that.

Remember that this project is designed for us to get a gauge on your approach and give us something to discuss with you face-to-face - we aren't looking for perfection. If there are things you'd like to have done but didn't have time - just make a note in your README.
